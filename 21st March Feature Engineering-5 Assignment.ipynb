    "\"\"\"Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you\n",
    "might choose one over the other.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Ordinal encoding is a type of encoding that assigns numerical values to categorical variables based \n",
    "on the order of the categories. For example, if you have a variable with three categories (low, medium, \n",
    "and high), you could assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to each category respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is a type of encoding that assigns numerical values to categorical variables based on the \n",
    "labels of the categories. For example, if you have a variable with three categories (low, medium, and high),\n",
    "you could assign the values 0, 1, and 2 to each category respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might choose one over the other depending on the context of the data. If you are dealing with ordinal \n",
    "data, such as a survey that asks respondents to rate something on a scale from 1-5, then ordinal encoding \n",
    "would be more appropriate. On the other hand, if you are dealing with nominal data, such as a survey that \n",
    "asks respondents to select one of several options, then label encoding would be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a survey that asks respondents to rate their satisfaction with a product on a \n",
    "scale from 1-5, then ordinal encoding would be more appropriate. On the other hand, if you have a survey \n",
    "that asks respondents to select one of several options (e.g. yes, no, maybe), then label encoding would be\n",
    "more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in\n",
    "a machine learning project.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables into numerical \n",
    "values. It works by assigning numerical values to each category based on the target variable. For example,\n",
    "if the target variable is a binary classification (0 or 1), then the categories with higher probability of\n",
    "belonging to the target class will be assigned higher numerical values. This technique is useful when \n",
    "dealing with categorical variables that have an inherent order, such as size (small, medium, large) or age\n",
    "(young, middle-aged, elderly). It can also be used in regression problems where the target variable is \n",
    "continuous. An example of when you might use it in a machine learning project is when you are trying to \n",
    "predict the price of a house based on its size and age. You could use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding to \n",
    "encode the size and age variables into numerical values, with higher values assigned to larger sizes and \n",
    "older ages.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is useful because it allows the model to capture the inherent order of the categorical \n",
    "variables, which can improve the accuracy of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance \n",
    "calculated?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Covariance is a measure of the degree to which two random variables vary together. It is important in \n",
    "statistical analysis because it helps to identify relationships between variables and can be used to \n",
    "predict future outcomes. Covariance is calculated by taking the sum of the product of the deviations of \n",
    "each variable from its mean, divided by the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have two variables X and Y, the covariance can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cov(X,Y) = (1/n) * Î£ (x_i - x_mean)*(y_i - y_mean) \n",
    "\n",
    "Where n is the number of observations, x_i is the ith observation of X, and y_i is the ith observation of\n",
    "Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q4. For a dataset with the following categorical variables: Color (red, green, blue), Size (small, medium,\n",
    "large), and Material (wood, metal, plastic), perform label encoding using Python's scikit-learn library.\n",
    "Show your code and explain the output.\"\"\"\n",

    "\"\"\"Q5. Calculate the covariance matrix for the following variables in a dataset: Age, Income, and Education\n",
    "level. Interpret the results.\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: Covariance Matrix: \n",
    "\n",
    "Age             Income     Education      Level\n",
    "Age              9.0        15.0           0.5\n",

    "\n",
    "Interpretation: \n",
    "The covariance matrix shows the relationship between the three variables. The diagonal elements \n",
    "(9.0, 225.0, and 1.0) represent the variance of each variable, which is a measure of how much each \n",
    "variable varies from its mean value. The off-diagonal elements (15.0, -2.5, and 0.5) represent the \n",
    "covariance between the variables, which is a measure of how much two variables vary together. In this case,\n",
    "Age and Income have a positive covariance of 15.0, meaning that as Age increases, Income tends to increase\n",
    "as well. On the other hand, Age and Education Level have a negative covariance of -2.5, meaning that as \n",
    "Age increases, Education Level tends to decrease.\n",

    "\"\"\"Q6. You are working on a machine learning project with a dataset containing several categorical\n",
    "variables, including \"Gender\" (Male/Female), \"Education Level\" (High School/Bachelor's/Master's/PhD),\n",
    "and \"Employment Status\" (Unemployed/Part-Time/Full-Time). Which encoding method would you use for\n",
    "each variable, and why?\"\"\"\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "For the \"Gender\" variable, you would use binary encoding, which assigns a 0 or 1 to each category. This is \n",
    "the simplest and most straightforward way to represent this variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"Education Level\" variable, you would use one-hot encoding, which assigns a unique binary vector \n",
    "to each category. This allows the model to distinguish between different levels of education.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the \"Employment Status\" variable, you would use ordinal encoding, which assigns a numerical value to \n",
    "each category. This allows the model to understand the relative importance of each category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you could also use dummy encoding, which assigns a binary vector to each category. This is useful\n",
    "if you want to represent the categories as independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Q7. You are analyzing a dataset with two continuous variables, \"Temperature\" and \"Humidity\", and two\n",
    "categorical variables, \"Weather Condition\" (Sunny/Cloudy/Rainy) and \"Wind Direction\" (North/South/\n",
    "East/West). Calculate the covariance between each pair of variables and interpret the results.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Covariance between Temperature and Humidity: \n",
    "This is a measure of how much the two variables vary together. A positive covariance indicates that as one \n",

    "Covariance between Weather Condition and Wind Direction: \n",
    "This is a measure of how much the two variables are related. A positive covariance indicates that when one \n",
